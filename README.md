# CatalogApi

CatalogApi is a library that can be used to make interacting with the
catalogapi.com API more straightforward in elixir.

**Note: this library is very far from stable at the moment. Once it hits 1.0 it
will be stable as per standard semantic versioning practices. Until that point,
use at your own risk.**

## Installation

CatalogApi can be installed by adding `catalog_api` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:catalog_api, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```
